Psychological test for secondary school students.

Test stack that was used to implement this Project:
 
1) PostgreSQL  (pgAdmin 4)
2) NetBeans IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
3) JDBC API (Java Database Connectivity)
4) Open VPN
5) Lanch4J
6) Resource Hacker

*Depending on the credentials that the end user will provide, they will be connected either to the role of the student who will simply complete the quiz, or to the role of the school's headquarter, who will be able to check which students failed the psychological test and see their data.

*A connection to the network of the academic institution of the International University of Greece is required (OpenVPN is recommended).
*The following can be used to test the app.
*Students who scored less than forty (<40) have failed the psychological test and the principal must inform their parent or guardian.

*I relied on the book 'The Nature of Adolescence (Adolescence and Society)' by the psychologist 'Coleman C. John', who supposedly works with the Ministry of Education, to introduce the questions in the psychological test.
