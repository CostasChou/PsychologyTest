Psychological test for secondary school students.

*Depending on the credentials the user will provide, he will be connected either as a student (1st user role) who will simply complete the quiz, or as the school's principal (2nd user role) who will be able to check which students failed the psychological test and see their data. Each user role will be landed a different home page and will be perform different actions.

*A connection to the network of the academic institution of the International University of Greece is required (OpenVPN is recommended).
*The following can be used to test the app.
*Students who scored less than forty (<40) failed the psychological test and the principal must inform their parent or guardian.

*I relied on the book 'Adolescent Psychology' by the psychologist 'Coleman C. John', who supposedly works with the Ministry of Education, to introduce the questions in the psychological test.
